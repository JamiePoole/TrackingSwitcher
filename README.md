TODO
- Show minimap tracking icon overlay/gui
- Stop ticker on manual tracker override
- North star: modify core behaviour allow users to select multiple trackers from default gui dropdown
- Once pause ends continue based on time-paused elapsed
- Localisation
- Key Bindings
- Command List on slash command without arguments
- Check potential bug when user changes their Tracking abilities (learns/unlearns profession/spell etc)
- Bug fix: After changing an Enabled Tracking Ability, hitting the 'Cancel' button doesn't revert the selection to the saved value, instead keeping its changed state when user re-opens Interface Options
